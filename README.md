# Thermostat.js
This was the first Javascript project I built. It's a dummy thermostat that has been programmed with power saving mode. It's a single page app which rerenders rather than redirects to a different page.

## Why I build this
This was a challenge set from Makers Academy to get us to grips with javascript and Jquery. 

## How to run
Find the index.html page from your finder and open it. You can toggle the power saving mode on or off. 

## Technologies used
Javascript, Jquery, HTML, CSS
